This is a modified version of `react-best-gradient-color-picker`
located https://github.com/hxf31891/react-gradient-color-picker

This was done to convert to typescript, add some additional features, remove redundant code (in my use case),
and most importantly, being able to use existing input components and apply dark mode styling.
